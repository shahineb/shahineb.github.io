# Research ¶

I focus on developing fast climate impact emulators that support efforts to make climate modeling more accessible, improve uncertainty quantification on impacts, and reduce computational costs of climate modelling.

I am currently a postdoctoral associate at [MIT EAPS](https://eaps.mit.edu/) working with [Raffaele Ferrari](http://ferrari.mit.edu/) and [Noelle Selin](https://www.selingroup.org/noelle-eckley-selin). I completed my PhD from the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford, supervised by [Dino Sejdinovic](https://sejdino.github.io/) as part of the [iMiracli](https://imiracli.web.ox.ac.uk/) innovative training network of aerosols-cloud interactions and machine learning. The tools I use mostly draw from the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and Gaussian processes, for which I enjoy a fond theoretical interest.




# Nechfate ¶

I am also a co-creator of [Nechfate](https://nechfate.ma/) [neʃfɛt], an online media that popularizes climate change, its impacts, and adaptation solutions in Morocco. For non-Arabic speakers, Nechfate refers initially to an aridification but also means a deterioration of economic conditions.


Through short, illustrated, and data-driven articles, our goal is to inform readers about Morocco's challenges in terms of Climate Change, Water & Agriculture, and Governance & Societ️y.
