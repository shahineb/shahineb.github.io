# Research ¶

I want to develop fast emulators of climate impacts that support efforts to make climate change projections more accessible, improve uncertainty quantification on impacts, and reduce the computational cost of climate modelling.

I am currently a postdoctoral associate at [MIT EAPS](https://eaps.mit.edu/) working with [Raffaele Ferrari](http://ferrari.mit.edu/) and [Noelle Selin](https://www.selingroup.org/noelle-eckley-selin). I completed my PhD from the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford, supervised by [Dino Sejdinovic](https://sejdino.github.io/) as part of the [iMiracli](https://imiracli.web.ox.ac.uk/) innovative training network of aerosols-cloud interactions and machine learning. The tools I use mostly draw from the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and Gaussian processes, for which I enjoy a fond theoretical interest.




# Nechfate ¶

I am also a co-creator of [Nechfate](https://nechfate.ma/) [neʃfɛt], an online media that popularizes climate change, its impacts, and adaptation solutions in Morocco. For non-Arabic speakers, Nechfate refers initially to an aridification but also means a deterioration of economic conditions.


Through short, illustrated, and data-driven articles, our goal is to inform readers about Morocco's challenges in terms of Climate Change, Water & Agriculture, and Governance & Societ️y.
