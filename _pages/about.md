# Research ¶

I am interested in developing simple and interpretable statistical machine learning methodologies to address challenges that arise in climate science. My recent work has focused climate model emulation using physically-informed models and statistical downscaling. The tools I use mostly draw from the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and Gaussian processes, for which I enjoy a fond theoretical interest.


I am a final year PhD in the [Oxford Computational Statistics and Machine Learning group](https://csml.stats.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford, supervised by [Dino Sejdinovic](https://sejdino.github.io/), [Tom Rainforth](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~twgr/) and [Athanasios Nenes](https://nenes.eas.gatech.edu/) as part of the [iMiracli](https://imiracli.web.ox.ac.uk/) innovative training network of aerosols-cloud interactions and machine learning.




# Nechfate ¶

I am a co-creator of [Nechfate](https://nechfate.ma/) [neʃfɛt], an online media that popularizes climate change, its impacts, and adaptation solutions in Morocco. For non-Arabic speakers, Nechfate refers initially to an aridification but also means a deterioration of economic conditions.


Through short, illustrated, and data-driven articles, our goal is to inform readers about Morocco's challenges in terms of Climate Change, Water & Agriculture, and Governance & Societ️y.
