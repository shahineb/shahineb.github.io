My research aims at developing simple and interpretable statistical machine learning methodologies to address challenges that arise in climate science. My recent work has focused on aggregate output learning for statistical downscaling and earth system emulation using physically-constrained models. The tools I use mostly draw from the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and Gaussian processes, for which I enjoy a fond theoretical interest.

I am currently in the 3rd year of my PhD in the [Oxford Computational Statistics and Machine Learning group](https://csml.stats.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford, supervised by [Dino Sejdinovic](https://sejdino.github.io/), [Athanasios Nenes](https://nenes.eas.gatech.edu/) and [Tom Rainforth](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~twgr/).


I am also co-founder of a the Moroccan media
